There is nothing useful here
Just a bunch of readme's that are not really useful 
of which i like the most
But i dont really like the following things:
1. Copying my repository or directory
2. Opening a long file like this one with the 'less' command
This readme is pretty long. I hope the checker will award me for the longest readme in Cohort 9
